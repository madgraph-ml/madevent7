Installation
============

Package
-------

Packages on PyPI are available for Linux and MacOS X (with Apple silicon),
for Python 3.11 to 3.14.::

    pip install madevent7

Build
-----

First install `scikit_build_core` with::

    pip install scikit_build_core

The pre-installed version of `cmake` under MacOS is outdated, so you might need to install a
newer version, for example with::

    brew install cmake

Then check out the `madevent7` repository and build and install it with::

    git clone git@github.com:madgraph-ml/madevent7.git
    cd madevent7
    pip install .

For a development version allowing for incremental build, use the following command instead::

    pip install --no-build-isolation -Cbuild-dir=build -Ccmake.build-type=RelWithDebInfo .

This will create a directory `build` where you can run make directly to make development
easier. To update the python module itself, make sure to also run the `pip install` command
above again. This will not happen automatically, even if you make the installation editable!
Build type `RelWithDebInfo` generates optimized code but includes debug symbols, so you
can use `lldb` or `gdb` to debug the code.
